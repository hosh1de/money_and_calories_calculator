## About the project.
  
I created this project for educational purposes in order to apply my new knowledge in it:
- Paradigms of object-oriented programming.
- Simple docstring documentation.
- Description of commits.
- Working with git.
- Working with github.
  
Beginners using the example of this project can learn for themselves some of these elements when creating their own small projects.
